# Cinema-Ticket-Kiosk
Application to process customer ticket purchases

Team Members: Grace Conti, Eliya Pelton

Description: Our program is the user interface for a movie theater kiosk that allows customers to select a movie and buy tickets. The customer chooses the showtime and inputs their information. The program then processes the purchase.

Data Structures: We used a linked list to store the showtime information and an array to store the accepted payment methods.

Task Assignments: Eliya designed the functions associated with the movie, showtimes, and the linked list. Grace designed the functions associated with processing the customer's information and purchase, as well as the array. Grace and Eliya collaborated to write functions to integrate the two portions of code and create a program to test it.
